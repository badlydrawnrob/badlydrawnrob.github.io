          <h2>😩 Want to beat the summer boredom?</h2>
          <p>If you’re like most parents, summer brings some familiar
          challenges:</p>
          </section>
          <figure>
          <img src="./build/static/computer-hero-kid.jpg"
          alt="Don’t be bored. Be a coding hero!" />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Don’t be bored. Be a coding
          hero!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Your child is glued to YouTube</strong> or games
          that teach them nothing.</li>
          <li><strong>They’re bored. You’re busy.</strong> And you’re
          running out of ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>You’re worried they’ll lose academic
          skills</strong> (“summer slide”) before school even
          starts.</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <p>The worst part? That wasted screen time could have been
          spent doing something that’s actually <em>fun</em> and
          <em>valuable</em> for their future.</p>
          <p>You’ve tried activity books… coding apps that felt too much
          like homework… even begging them to do something
          “productive.”</p>
          <p>But nothing sticks.</p>
          <p>Here’s the truth: Kids don’t hate learning. They just need
          the <em>right</em> kind of learning—something that feels like
          a game and keeps their curiosity alive.</p>

          Hey, I’m [Your Name], and I Help Kids Fall in Love with
          Coding</h2>
          <p>Over the past 5 years, I’ve taught coding to over 800
          learners—from 8 to 80 years old.</p>
          <p>I believe learning to code should be <strong>fun, creative,
          and confidence-building.</strong> Not intimidating or
          boring.</p>
          <p>That’s why I created <strong>Code for Kids - Ozaria Summer
          Coding Adventure</strong>. It’s built around
          <strong>Ozaria</strong>, a story-rich coding platform used in
          classrooms worldwide.</p>
          <p>With Ozaria, kids don’t just learn to code—they become the
          heroes of their own game.</p>
          <p><strong>As seen in:</strong></p>
          <ul>
          <li>Trusted by educators worldwide</li>
          <li>90% of students feel confident coding after Ozaria</li>
          <li>99% say they <em>enjoy</em> learning with it</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And now, your child can try it for free—this summer.</p>

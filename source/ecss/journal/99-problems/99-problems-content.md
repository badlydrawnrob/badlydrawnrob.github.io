Ask 100 people what data is to them, you'd probably get 100 answers and a lot of To those of you who thing  a 5 year struggle to learn Python, lot's of books and I've been many things to many people over the years, but one thing that has increasingly frustrated me is when things don't work.A quick way to empty a room would be to waffle on about


[Who am I? That's as hard a question to pin down as "what is data analysis?" I've studied through 3D design, Graphic Design, Fine Art (the odd crisis of confidence or minor burnout), digital design, frontend code, backend code, and currently working my way through data analysis and beyond. If I look back on my life, I'm not entirely sure how on earth I got here.

I _hated_ excel in school. Still do. Data analysis and code doesn't come easy to me, but as we live in a sea of information, I see how useful it can be. I guess I want to ...]

I'm making a few assumptions here:

1. You're busy.
2. You have too much to do, too many distractions, too little time.

Most analysis falls into two categories: a _problem/people_ fit, or a _people/problem_ fit. Let me explain:

| Problem / People | People / Problem |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1. Explore _your_ problem | 3. Communicate with people
| 2. Build a story around _your_ target | 2. Build a story around _their_ target |
| 3. Communicate this  to people | 1. Solve _their_ problem |

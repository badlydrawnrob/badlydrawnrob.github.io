Do we need another article about time management and estimates? It could be about software development, but it could be about any service-based, deadline-focused profession. Programming as an analogy for interpersonal projects (lego bricks, lego men)

> Visualise examples of service design work (or relate against easily priced products) that are analagous to programming concepts — gradually moving away from programming-as-a-service but it seems to have parallels ...
> Distill it down to it's bare essentials (one for pricing; one for "how long will it take?")

Some years I've done well. Some years I haven't. _I may be wrong (doubtTM)_ like to think I have enough experience to weigh in on the ever-ongoing debate.

I've considered this in an ad-hoc, evolving kind of way, raised prices, revised contracts, etc etc (similar to the way the standard project works)

1. Be kind and understanding
2. From both perspectives (client/consultant)
3. Not so much talking about billing methods; but the overall problem

- General journal entry about freelance/contract work (not specific industry)
- Bugs, knowns, known unknowns, don't know we don't know (unknown unknowns)
    - I would say, anything outside 1 known-task should work as a sprint
        - Can you (as a client) make decisions about requirements? Are you qualified?
        - Do you know the granularity of detail required?
        - Are you aware of the potential [knowns**3]?
    - Unknown constraints or bugs in the system
    - Not enough respect given to research and planning
        - I want this thing done. Here's a list of tasks that I think will need to be completed to get this thing done.
        - That's not how it works.
    - Moving away from subjective towards objective (no guesswork, sensible/clever trial-by-error, software is an iterative process, don't be afraid of uncertainty/obscurity, embrace uncertainty)
    - Can fix, can't fix, won't fix (depending, agile methodology)
    - Agile is just learning as you go.
        - One thing at a time; reduce cognitive load; focus on the task at hand
    - NOBODY is an expert in project management; things go wrong
    - Your spec can be as detailed as you like; it rarely works out that way
    - Added complexity / annoyances (software, process, delays, human aspect)
    - Meeting of minds (are you on the same page? mental models? miscommunication)
    - Revisions, bugs, changing minds, difference of opinions, test-driven
        - When the answer is not the answer (do you know if this will work?)
        - Not asking enough questions?
        - Who pays for extra time (football analogy)
            - Admin, extra charges/things
        - Time constraints (vs fine-tuning, testing, etc)
        - Focusing on specifics (micro-tasks, charging that way)
            - Get's messy and hypothetical, not agile
        - Would you write a business plan that way? Fuck no.
            - Fixed vs ad-hoc (things change quickly these days)
            - Does it work?
            - Routes and failures (1 route takes time to develop and test)
            - Relying on other people or third party `X` to work as expected
            - Margins of error (or padding time)
- The price is rarely the price
- Buckets, agile billing, hourly billing
- Stress, financial uncertainty, etc
- Projected vs actual
- Percentage of software projects over budget (or general projects for that matter)
    - railway lines
    - other big overruns (bridges/architecture/etc)
- No silver bullets?
- Human delays
    - delays cost time and money
    - delays in asset management
    - delays in people management
    - human error
    - external factors
    - Knock on effects (moving parts; one effects another)
- Delays in payment
    - Sign off process (time consuming; turnaround)
    - Getting paid
    - Disputes or ongoing work
    - Overspill/late payments
- AUTOMATION: what tasks can you automate?
- RISK (How many clients do they have? How many dependents do you have?)
- LOST IN TRANSLATION (price/task/requirements)
- SIZE of company; level of RISK; overall BENEFIT or VALUE
- Avoiding mess (messy project management, human relations, contact, conversations)
    - Blowing away the cobwebs; tidying up loose ends (old code / bad code)
    - Do they care? (speed impacts everything else)
    - Divergence in organising/implementation
        + Client adds something that breaks something else
        + Not thinking holistically (speed of implementation vs long-term costs)
        + Developer struggles if not consulted
- How much does it take to change the color? — WHAT ANALOGY GOES HERE?
    - Discuss what colours they like out there in the wild
    - Go away and design a few variants of that color, based on discussion
    - Present to client (if you're good, limit options and gently nudge direction)
    - They like it or they don't. If they don't go to #1
    - Sign off on colour. Get started proper.
    - Open file (or download current version of code)
    - find code (variable, or if you're stupid all instances of code)
    - Change code (easy in this case)
    - Version code (easy in this case)
    - Push code to development server (if you're cautious)
    - Push code to live server (if you're not)
    - Test code (does it work in all the places?)
    - Cool! Email client -> Client review -> OK -> Bill client -> WAIT -> Buy coffee.


Do a line with client / worker on either side

* What does the client want/expect? [up the chain: contact --> their client]
    + Levels of clients (how many clients do you have?)
    + Transactional  -vs-  value-based  -vs-  consultancy  -vs-  IP
    + Low value or high value task?
    + What is your review process? Who's involved in the process?
    + Do you have a budget? Or are you fishing (I want a good deal)
    + Who is involved in the process? Who's the lead contact? Who's in charge? Who's the decision maker?
* What does the service-worker want/expect?
    + Is it reliable income? Spec-work? Need it quick? Once in a while?
    + Can I give you flexibility or is it of limited value to me?
    + Are you a patron, or a liability?
    + Quick job or ongoing work?
    + Low risk or high risk task?
    + Is it worth it to me to give you a discount? What do I get in return? (day rate, week rate)
    + What if you cancel or change your mind?
    + Can I manage my cashflow and allocate my time this way? How much do I need to earn per month to get by? What do I want to earn?
    + Is the work worth it? (hassle, stress, etc)
    + kill fee / copyright / contract / scope creep
    + Do you want a monkey (follows orders), or someone who challenges you (or works with you to ...)
    + Wasted time quoting and estimating
* Where are the differences of opinion/expectations?


1. Agile billing: billing cycles
    + rough estimate or lower/higher price bracket);
    + clearer as you go
    + margin error depending on clarity of requirements (50% > 20% etc)
    + show previous margins of error (gives ammunition for next ones)
    + list your assumptions and preconditions
    + Tell them "I'll get back to you"
2. Hourly billing: Pay-as-you-go; estimate per task
3. Fixed cost billing:
4. Value-based pricing



## This

- Only work by the hour (not set project cost)
- Monthly budget for time spent (paid at end of month)
- Use GoCardless for invoicing (or bill them automatically?)
- Let them know the benefits (more flexibility with changes etc)
- TRACK YOUR FUCKING TIME

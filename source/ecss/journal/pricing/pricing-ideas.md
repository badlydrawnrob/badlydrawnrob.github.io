## Basically:

1. Pricing graded by when they pay (pre-book `$`, 7 day `$$`, 30 day `$$`)
2. Block book days and charge by the hour
3. Value based pricing on some projects (bigger collaborations)
4. Block book a month for a set price (set number of on-site days and other stuff)

Everyone pays. No excuses.

> **[SHOULD WE NEVER GIVE ESTIMATES?](http://agileupgrade.com/stop-wasting-time-trying-to-get-estimates-right-and-what-to-do-instead/)**

## What are the not paying for?

- Backups, security etc
- Admin (within reason). 15 mins or so initial scoping to give a realistic estimate.
- **Solutions** not **hours** :)
    - If they're on a tight budget, we work to that
        - but, we do what we can, in the allocated time. No overruns.
        - what happens when a project overruns?

## What are they paying for?

They're paying me a little for design, strategy (with Matt), build, and long-term stability of code.

- They pay for strategy, planning and visual work on the day
   - **15 mins** of chatting to get an idea of what they're looking to achieve, but the real work starts within the `sprint`. So any visuals, fine-tuning, etc, etc is chargable.
- **[Finding and solving their pain points](http://99u.adobe.com/articles/38599/what-should-i-charge-how-to-justify-your-freelance-rates)**
- **ALWAYS withhold work** until full payment has been made!!!

## What should happen?

- Review, signoff and invoice generated on day (or day after) the work completed
- I to be flexible, but overdue payments can't be tolerated

## What are they getting?

- Negotiate on scope, not price.
- If he wants proof of value, let's give it to him (metrics, speedtest, etc)
- Find out what the real issue is (Jamie or Matt's confidence in selling)
- Itemise the features we fix? (rather than day rate)
- Low-value work can be budgeted for properly, well in advance, with (non-refundable) deposit.
  - "We've had a good month, so have £1,000 to budget for maintenance work in 3 weeks time"
  - It's about guaranteeing my availability for the required time.
  - Ad hoc work, or fast turnaround requires flexibility and availability and dropping other opportunities (or rescheduling), so needs to be charged accordingly.
  - "We need to generate 10 new leads, so X banner/content/code is required by next Mon"

## What _could_ they get?

- Designing banner ads / visuals / campaign tracking (as part of run of work)

## Break down of pricing

Depending on how you'd like to pay, we have different day rates:

1. `£350`—`£380`: 30 days in advance
    - Project is not mission critical or time sensitive
    - Book and pay in advance, at least **50% upfront (non-refundable)**
    - No flexibility on dates, if you miss them, deposit is gone.
    - Remainder payment is due on sign-off, otherwise following rates apply
2.  `£400`: Payment due within _**7 days** after receipt of invoice_
    - All work stops until overdue amount is paid
3. `£450`—`£500`: Payment due within _**30 days** after receipt of invoice_
    - All work stops until overdue amount is paid
    - After 30 days, [statutory interest](https://www.gov.uk/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery/charging-interest-commercial-debt) will be added until invoice settled and is [in accordance with EU law](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/sell-abroad/payments/late-payment/index_en.htm)
    - **[OR `compound_interest` at 1%](https://goo.gl/MfRTso) _daily_**

> **Repeat overdue payments may result in termination of contract/work**

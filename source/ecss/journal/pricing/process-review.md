I thought it would be a good idea to clarify some thinking, to reach something we're both satisfied with. It's a reasonably new way of working so please understand it's evolving.

Think of it as a rough contract agreement that I'd use going forward for clients. Most of the points are covered in our current agreement and day rate — ideally we can discuss this all in person:


## What you ARE investing in

A collaborative process: design, strategy, build, and long-term stability of code.

- **Results**, not a fixed hourly estimate
- **Availability**, flexibility and fast turnaround
- **Completing tasks** in real time (no guesswork)
    + Pre-sprint expectations are considered and you're presented with a realistic plan/budget
        + Within this budget I allow a little time for revisions, bugs and conversation. So far, this has helped reduce [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and underestimating time.
        + Research, sketches and design within a sprint get to the root of the problem ...
        + ... and feedback into a real-time estimate, informing build and expected results.
- **Managing expectations**
    + Many tasks cannot be given as a fixed hourly estimate as they're solved as we go, adjusting sprint tasks time/budget where appropriate
        + A rough percentage breakdown where possible, but it's better to use this only as a guide (see _completing tasks_)
        + Our in-page navigation task is a good example of this: unexpected positioning issues with extra designs needed to inform the build.
        + Others involve wrestling with browser-specific issues, 3rd-party software issues, or general complexities of code.
- **Value**
    + See below, needs more discussion:
        + Time + Value + Risk
            + Proof of value can be discussed and implemented together if needed
- **Daily blocking**
    + I'd also prefer to stick to the daily blocking
        + Prevents flitting between projects so I can dedicate attention 100% on the tasks in hand
        + Every time you have to revisit a project, it takes a little time to "warm up", so blocking out time prevents wasted time.
        + If you're really strapped, perhaps we can do half days where necessary after the first full day.


## What you're NOT investing in

In all my years of experience, a set of deliverables as a hand-off from a designer rarely works (unless working in very close proximity). A list of "things to do" rarely stays static, or at the very least is subject to unknowns.

While some tasks are reasonably straightforward (a simple css colour change), most need research, design, testing, tracking or iteration.

These are some of the things you _aren't_ investing in:

- A **"hired hand"**
    + Neither of us want to produce work of low value.
    + Neither of us want to waste time, or money
    + Tasks aren't generally transactional (they're collaborative)
- **Guesswork**
    + My goal is to figure out what business needs are, work effectively, get the results you're looking for and reduce as much "guesswork" as possible.
    + An hourly estimate can sometimes lead to negative outcomes:
        + Timesheet "padding" (to deal with unexpected outcomes)
        + Increased expectations from client (occasionally unrealistic)
            + Strained relationships on both sides. Stressful.
        + Who takes the strain when a project overruns?
            + The client? (increase budget)
            + The freelancer? (increase time / decrease income)
- A **fixed hourly** estimate
    + You can, of course, set a cap on hours or budget, but each has it's downsides
        + For example, a form could come in many formats. One of which might increase your sign up rate by 20%. The more time spent on research, testing, iteration, the better your results could be.
        + See Time + Value + Risk "to-do" list
- **Backups**
    + I don't generally release code until a project has cleared, but once released it's your responsibility to backup and keep secure.


## Other notes

### Reducing overspend

What I'm especially trying to avoid, is having to add extra time onto the budget unless _absolutely_ necessary (from contract):

> We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the number of days that we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for those additional days.

### Reducing waste and risk

Some projects over the years have unfortunately been victim of waste, in terms of my time, client time, or investment — for a number of reasons, but lack of clear direction often being one of them.

Nobody wants to waste time and money on a project that fails, so more and more I'm trying to limit risk.

I'm sure you're doing a great job of tracking already, but if you're on a tight budget one helpful thing you can do is to create mini experiments, taking into account _time_ to complete, _value_ created, with the _risk_ involved. There's a few data-related methods when the time is right.

Something we can discuss further another time, but everything I've read recently seems to be pointing in this direction (not everything can, or should be tested, but it's definitely something to consider)

### Managing project signoff

EvaluAgent is a challenging one in this respect, as often code needs to go live before it can be reviewed.

There's a way to review code outside of Hubspot, but it'd take significant investment to get ready. It's an ideal, but might not be worth the effort right now if you're staying lean.

However, this means I have no leverage on payment terms, as I can't withold work as I normally would prior to invoices clearing.

This is something that we've raised before but can't be stated enough — I'm working in good faith, but will go out of business if clients aren't paying promptly for work completed.

If there's a specific issue with a previous invoice (or your current finances) please do let me know — outstanding invoices should be cleared before any further tasks are started.

That's not good for either party, so if the work I do is valuable to you I'd much appreciate keeping on top of things.

As stated before I'll aim to streamline my own payment methods in future.


## Time + Value + Risk

Thinking of tasks as a combination of these factors could be useful when weighting tasks. Taken from Lean Startup / Lean Analytics etc. For example:

- Small css change
    - low time, low risk, low value
        + Not harmful to include in a sprint.
- New component (needs to be tested, uncertain return)
    - high time, high risk, potentially high value
        + Can be considered, but probably a stripped down minimal viable component that can be A/B tested. Can be enhanced if it works well.

That's a rough guide, but it seems to be how the big boys are working things.

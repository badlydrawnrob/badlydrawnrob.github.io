Life is a learning process. It's full of big hairy problems (and little ones too!). I solve problems <b class="highlight highlight-underline">for people</b> with data.

## Which people?

```python
people = ['academics','agencies','brands','startups']
```

People are not a <abbr title="number">#</abbr>. They're not just a statistic. They're individuals, complex, emotionally driven.

I help [people, big and small,] achieve a people-first approach to data, answering questions like:

1. How many customers are we losing due to their first experience with us?
2. Sales took a hit last month â€”Â which products are likely to sell this month?
3. How do we streamline our process so we can spend more time creating actionable insights, less time cleaning up sloppy data?

If someone <b class="highlight highlight-underline">eats</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">drinks</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">buys</b>, or <b class="highlight highlight-underline">reads</b> it; chances are I can help.





## ðŸŽ¯ Values and goals

<del>Everything is a priority.</del> <strong class="highlight highlight-underline">This</strong> is our priority right now. Here's how we're going to try and solve it, here's how we know if it's been a success.

I'm making a few assumptions here:

1. You're busy.
2. You have too much to do, too many distractions, too little time.

Not sure where to start? Not sure what creates the most value? Not sure what Not sure what [...]

1. Test hunches
2. Track success

[Your target -- my process -- boring data]

### There are no silver bullets

Data analysis is an art; it can take a few attempts to nail it. My role is to challenge your assumptions, create tiny experiments, and bring you insights on your people.

The rest is up to you.

### Current focus:

> Customer insights, Ã  la carte

My latest research project is the booming indy food scene in Newcastle. Helping "The Journey" to find the drivers of growth and customer experience by asking:

1. Who are our customers?
2. Why are they visiting?
3. When are they visiting?
4. What for?

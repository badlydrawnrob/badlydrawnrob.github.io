Solving problems for people with data

## Description

customer insight · digital strategy · design thinking · data analysis

I help people decide what to do next. I collaborate with people, just like you, to design frameworks and experiments which challenge your assumptions and facilitate thought. I'm good at simplifying the complex and solving problems with data.

I help people answer questions like:

— “How do we build a community around our people?”
— “A customer told me he loved my product, but sales are down this month … what gives?”
— “We don’t really understand why people are doing this. How do we ask the right questions?”
— “We’re busy. We’d like to worry less and sell more. What should we track to hit our targets?”
— “Our analysts are sick of throwing out the garbage. How can we streamline our process?”
— “We’re stumped as to why our first-time customers don’t return. Why?”


1. Define your focus
2. Ask the right questions
3. Collect useful data
4. Test your ideas
5. Does it work?

Only, a self-congratulatory promo-piece on a typical Linkedin profile isn't real life. We are not robots. People are complex and emotional. The world is full of noise; hairy, complex problems (and little ones too). In such a world, how does an individual or business find it's orbit? Let alone stick to it?

If you're even a tiny bit like me, you're daily life is a mixture of doubt, hunches, rabbit holes and to-do lists ... all that normal human stuff. It's good to remind yourself from time to time that all of us are fallible and that's ok. The only important thing in life is "does it work?"

In my experience, most people haven't a clue what data analysis is. Why would they? It's only helpful in context. Data is useless without a problem to be solved. Big data often doesn't lead to the kind of insights you can have talking to a human.

Most assumptions can be tested. Opportunities spotted. Small, low-cost experiments to validate an idea, or expose it as a failure. Having conversations with the right people, asking the right questions. Gathering facts and acting on them.

That's all data analysis is. The rest is up to you.

My main areas of research are food and literature. I enjoy getting involved with nice people on fun, creative, interesting, or exciting projects.

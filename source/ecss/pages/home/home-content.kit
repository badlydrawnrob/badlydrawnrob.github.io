<p>I&#8217;m going to let you into a little secret. If you asked a young schoolboy going by the name of <i class="highlight highlight-italic">Rob McDonald</i> what he&#8217;d like to do for a living, it most certainly wouldn&#8217;t be working with data.</p>

<p>Zoom forward 25 years, a degree in Illustration and Design, a back catalogue of websites, projects, successes and failures (most of which no longer with us), there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned; the only thing that matters is &#8220;does it work?&#8221;.</p>

<p>To me, it&#8217;s a question that doesn&#8217;t get asked often enough. How many man hours have been wasted by failing to understand a problem? Not having a clear direction? Blindly following a hunch without hard evidence? It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a student, professional, businessman, house-wife (or -husband) â€” we all struggle to process the sheer amount of data the world produces everyday.</p>

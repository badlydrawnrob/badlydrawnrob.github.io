I'm going to let you into a little secret. If you asked a young schoolboy going by the name of <i class="highlight highlight-italic">Rob McDonald</i> what he'd like to do for a living, it most certainly wouldn't be working with data.

Zoom forward 25 years, a degree in Illustration and Design, a back catalogue of websites, projects, successes and failures (most of which no longer with us), there's one thing I've learned; the only thing that matters is "does it work?".

To me, it's a question that doesn't get asked often enough. How many man hours have been wasted by failing to understand a problem? Not having a clear direction? Blindly following a hunch without hard evidence? It doesn't matter if you're a student, professional, businessman, house-wife (or -husband) â€” we all struggle to process the sheer amount of data the world produces everyday.

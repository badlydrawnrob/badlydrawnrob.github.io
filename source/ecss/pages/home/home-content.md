**Life is a learning process.** It's full of big hairy problems (and little ones too!). I solve problems <b class="highlight highlight-underline">for people</b> with data.

## Who said data had to be boring?

[A brief intro into how the fuck I got here ... possibly rename it something other than data]

[Who am I? That's as hard a question to pin down as "what is data analysis?" I've studied through 3D design, Graphic Design, Fine Art (the odd crisis of confidence or minor burnout), digital design, frontend code, backend code, and currently working my way through data analysis and beyond. If I look back on my life, I'm not entirely sure how on earth I got here.

I _hated_ excel in school. Still do. Data analysis and code doesn't come easy to me, but as we live in a sea of information, I see how useful it can be. I guess I want to ...]

[Talk about failures and wins —> want to learn through data without my own bias and assumptions (or other peoples) throwing me off course. I want to build things that **work**]

- Make data entry fun
- Make data useful, honest and understandable
    - engage, inform, act, insights

Help people dream up creative, effective ways to collect and present data. Solve people problems ... [basic examples]

## Which people?

```python
people = [
    'customers',
    'visitors',
    'academics',
    'brands',
    'agencies',
    'startups'
]
```

> **People are not just a <abbr title="number">#</abbr>, or a statistic;** they're individuals, complex, emotionally driven.

I help you solve people problems. I take a people-first look at the world with data, helping you answer questions like:

1. "How do we build a community around our people?"
2. "A customer told me he loved my product, but sales are down this month ... what gives?"
3. "We don't really understand why people are doing this. How do we ask the right questions?"
4. "We're busy. We'd like to worry less and sell more. What should we track to hit our targets?"
5. "Our analysts are sick of throwing out the <abbr title="garbage in garbage out">garbage</abbr>. How can we streamline our process?"
6. "We're stumped as to why our first-time customers don't return. Why?"

If someone <b class="highlight highlight-underline">eats</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">drinks</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">buys</b>, or <b class="highlight highlight-underline">reads</b> it; chances are I can help.


## Current focus:

> Customer insights, à la carte

My latest research project is the booming indy food scene in Newcastle. Communicating with the local café scene, surveys and customer interviews to understand the drivers of growth and "good" customer experience by asking:

1. Who are our customers?
2. Why are they visiting?
3. When are they visiting?
4. What for?

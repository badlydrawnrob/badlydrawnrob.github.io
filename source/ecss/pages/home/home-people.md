## Which people?

```python
people = [
    'customers',
    'visitors',
    'academics',
    'brands',
    'agencies',
    'startups'
]
```

> **People are not just a <abbr title="number">#</abbr>, or a statistic;** they're individuals, complex, emotionally driven.

I help you solve people problems. I take a people-first look at the world with data, answering questions like:

1. "How do we build a community around our people?"
2. "A customer told me he loved my product, but sales are down this month ... what gives?"
3. "We don't really understand why people are doing this. How do we ask the right questions?"
4. "We're busy. We'd like to worry less and sell more. What should we track to hit our targets?"
5. "Our analysts are sick of throwing out the <abbr title="garbage in garbage out">garbage</abbr>. How can we streamline our process?"
6. "We're stumped as to why our first-time customers don't return. Why?"

If someone <b class="highlight highlight-underline">eats</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">drinks</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">buys</b>, or <b class="highlight highlight-underline">reads</b> it; chances are I can help.

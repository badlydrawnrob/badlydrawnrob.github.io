## ðŸŽ¯ Values and goals



I'm making a few assumptions here:

1. You're busy.
2. You have too much to do, too many distractions, too little time.

Most analysis falls into two categories: a _problem/people_ fit, or a _people/problem_ fit. Let me explain:

| Problem / People | People / Problem |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1. Explore _your_ problem | 3. Communicate with people
| 2. Build a story around _your_ target | 2. Build a story around _their_ target |
| 3. Communicate this  to people | 1. Solve _their_ problem |

<!-- story = an experiment, focus, data plan, marketing plan, etc
target = values, goals, tasks
communicate = the interactions you have -->

<!-- 1. Test hunches
2. Track success -->

[Your target -- my process -- boring data]

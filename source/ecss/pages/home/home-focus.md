## Current focus:

> Customer insights, à la carte

My latest research project is the booming indy food scene in Newcastle. Communicating with the local café scene, surveys and customer interviews to understand the drivers of growth and "good" customer experience by asking:

1. Who are our customers?
2. Why are they visiting?
3. When are they visiting?
4. What for?

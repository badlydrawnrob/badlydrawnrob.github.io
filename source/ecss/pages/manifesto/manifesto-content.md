Creativity without constraints is a little like a satellite without an orbit. It can be flung off in any direction, which isn't much help to anyone.

Without getting too ahead of myself, it's been said I'm a fairly principled chap. Our values and goals are often a matter of perspective, but I find a <i>manifesto</i>, of sorts, a useful tool.

While our orbits might twist and turn, isn't it a good idea to plot a path?



1. Make it as simple as possible, but never simpler
    - Reduce complex ideas to achievable goals, one thing at a time, learn as you go, be like [Feynman](http://www.feynman.com).
2. No bullshit
    - Aim to be a source of <abbr title="What is reality? In this case let's call Truth™ the knowledge of the facts at hand">Truth™</abbr>, earn the trust of the people I collaborate with, or the [six degrees of seperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).
3. [Keep it secret, keep it safe](#kiskis)
    - In a connected, digital, data-obsessed world, _privacy matters_. As a society it's our job protect the people we serve, even when mind-numbingly difficult (oh how I love you, [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/))
4. Make it easy, make it seamless
    - In a world full of distractions, time is precious. It may be Jane, the new mum, trying to organise life; Mike the cafe owner, too busy to think; or Jaylah, the <abbr title="this is a highly contentious statement, but you get the point">apathetic</abbr> millenial who wants it right now. Be respectful of people's time.
5. <b class="highlight highlight-underline">Why</b> is more important than <b class="highlight highlight-underline">how</b>
    - I'll forgo the rant about <i>too many [useless, wasteful, ...] `X`</i> in the world. What's the _focus_? what's the _goal_? What is it _for_? Why _bother_?
6. Humans are more important than robots
    - A victim of tech fatigue myself, I'd love to — in some small way — participate in a humanist vision. I believe that, without constraints, tech is fundamentally anti-social and can be negative for mental health. To me, online should _only_ be a means of improving _offline_ conversations, relationships and life.
7. Open doors are better than closed ones
    - One of my, yet to be proven, theories is that collaboration is <abbr title="Greater than or equal to">`≥`</abbr> a hyper-competitive marketplace. Healthy competition is fine, but I'm happy to collaborate with people who share the same values.
8. Life, is a learning process
    - As in, you're never done. In these divisive times, we could all do with getting a little more comfortable with _doubt_. Start small, conquer your fears, test what can be tested, but try not to make too many assumptions.
9. Never stick to a goal that has been proven wrong
    - _Wrong_, as in _Truth™_, can be highly subjective and this rule is _extremely_ hard to follow. No matter how much data you collect, you can never know the full picture. Be honest; Help, not harm; Do the best job with the information at hand.

## 😩 Want to beat the summer boredom?

If you’re like most parents, summer brings some familiar challenges ...

</div><!-- /.b-left -->
</div><!-- /.breakout -->

<div class="bc-four">

- **Your child is glued to YouTube** or games that teach them nothing.
- **They’re bored. You're busy.** And you’re running out of ideas.
- **You're worried they’ll lose academic skills** (“summer slide”) before school even starts.

The worst part? That wasted screen time could have been spent doing something that’s actually *fun* and *valuable* for their future.

You’ve tried activity books… coding apps that felt too much like homework… even begging them to do something "productive."

But nothing sticks.

Here’s the truth: Kids don’t hate learning. They just need the *right* kind of learning—something that feels like a game and keeps their curiosity alive.

## 👋 Hey, I’m Rob, and I help kids fall in love with Coding

> Over the past 5 years, I’ve taught coding to over 800 learners — from 8 to 60 years old.

I believe learning to code should be **fun, creative, and confidence-building.** Not intimidating or boring.

That’s why I'm running **Code for Kids - Ozaria Summer Coding Adventure**. It’s built around **Ozaria**, a story-rich coding platform used in classrooms worldwide.

With Ozaria, kids don’t just learn to code—they become the heroes of their own game.

**Why kids love Ozaria**

- Trusted by educators worldwide
- 90% of students feel confident coding after Ozaria
- 99% say they *enjoy* learning with it

And now, your child can try it for free—this summer.

### Help kids to solve problems themselves

> **Why it matters:** Creative coding keeps them engaged and gives them a sense of ownership.

Kids don’t just follow lessons — they learn how to problem solve and look up solutions by themself


### Story-based challenges

> **Why it matters:** Storytelling sparks imagination and makes abstract concepts easier to grasp.

They'll become the main character in a coding quest that unfolds as they learn.


### Teamwork & collaboration

> **Why it matters:** Builds communication, problem-solving, and peer confidence.

Even online, they’ll solve challenges together.


### Simple & accessible

# Orbit
## A manifesto (of sorts)

> **Creativity without constraints** is a little like a satellite without an orbit ... It can drift off in any direction, which isn’t much help to anyone!

I've been around the block and back a few times by now; I have a tendency towards ethics and principles, but pragmatic enough to know how the world really works. Our values and goals are often a matter of perspective, but I find a _manifesto_ (in one form or another) a useful tool.

While our orbits might twist and turn, isn't it a good idea to plot a path?

1.  **Make it as simple as possible, but never simpler**
    - Reduce complex ideas to achievable goals, split into tasks, completing one task at a time. Learn as you go, be like [Feynman](http://www.feynman.com).
2.  **No bullshit**
    - Aim to be a source of Truth™, earn the trust of the people I collaborate with, or the [six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).
3.  **Keep it secret, keep it safe**
    - In a connected, digital, data-obsessed world, *privacy matters*. As a society it’s our job protect the people we serve, even when mind-numbingly difficult (oh how I love you, [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/))
4.  **Make it easy, make it seamless**
    - It may be Jane, the new mum, trying to organise life; Mike the cafe owner, too busy to think; or Jaylah, the apathetic millennial who wants it right now. Be respectful of people’s time.
5.  **_Why_ is more important than _how_**
    - I’ll forgo the rant about *too many \[useless, wasteful, …\] `X`* in the world. What’s the *focus*? what’s the *goal*? What is it *for*? Why *bother*?
6.  **Humans are more important than robots**
    - As a recovering tech fatigue victim myself, I’d love to — in some small way — contribute to a humanist vision. Although the [science still isn’t clear](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload) on an always-connected world, I believe without constraints tech can have a negative impact on mental health. Online communication is *not the same* as offline interaction; for me, online should *only* be a means of improving *offline* conversations, relationships and life.
7.  **Open doors are better than closed ones**
    - One of my, yet to be proven, theories is that collaboration is ≥ a hyper-competitive marketplace. Healthy competition is fine, but I’m happy to collaborate with people who share the same values.
8.  **Life, is a learning process**
    - As in, you’re never done. In these divisive times, we could all do with getting a little more comfortable with *doubt*. Start small, conquer your fears, test what can be tested, but try not to make too many assumptions.
9.  **Never stick to a goal that has been proven wrong**
    - *Wrong*, as in *Truth™*, can be highly subjective and this rule is *extremely* hard to follow. No matter how much data you collect, you can never know the full picture. Be honest with yourself and others; do the best job with the information at hand; help as much as possible; harm as little as possible.

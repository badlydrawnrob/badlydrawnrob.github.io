## To Do

> For now I don't care about anything other than quick info, and a sales pitch for the kids code club. Nothing else matters for this sprint.

- I'm not sure it's so great having `@media` all over the page
    - i.e: inside multiple `.classes`.
    - I understand the usefulness of having everything for a specific `.class` in one place however.
- Can our print styles cope with having things in a `grid` layout?
    - See BBC and other websites.
- Begin a more rigourous writing style for very basic things.
- Having all sorts of pages within the `ecss` folder needs changing?
    - This should be for components, if at all.

## Notes
- **A lot of repetition with `@media screen` size**
- Possibly fix the line-height of first paragraph
- Look over `ol` and `ol` (especially children)
- [Remove `html` extensions](https://rsp.github.io/gh-pages-no-extension/)
- [ssl](https://hackernoon.com/set-up-ssl-on-github-pages-with-custom-domains-for-free-a576bdf51bc)
- [ecss eg](https://benfrain.com)
- Tidy up structure
- More rigorous writing style

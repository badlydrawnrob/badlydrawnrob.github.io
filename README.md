## To Do

1. Simplify articles (ONE idea per slide)
2. Lead magnets (teaching, flashcards, etc)
3. Thema CSS and GPS style (and simplify code where possible)
4. Remove EVERYTHING that's ECSS style (model-first, not components first)
4. Build it with Elm Lang (using `json` data and markdown)

## `@media`

- How am I handling light/dark theme, mobile-first, print-first, and so on?
- Are lots of `@media` queries preferable?
- A nice grid layout, with 2-column articles and interesting layout
- Buttons should make more sense (no need for Tally form button AND other button)

##Â Writing

> Start simple for now (build later/never)
> Is it fun to look at? (finger painting for adults and kids)

**Be more legible at all screen sizes (current font/size sucks for articles).** Make some concrete rules for yourself on writing. Add more colour to your writing, with fun examples. Perhaps add nice typographic touches like ligatures (or pull-quotes, pull-images, so on).

## Money

1. Store up a full years wages
2. Then start to invest small amounts
3. Build up income drips and get f* moving

## Compiler

Currently using a pandoc template, but processing some `.md` files with Marked2 App.
Be consistent, simplify the build script (consider using static site generator?)

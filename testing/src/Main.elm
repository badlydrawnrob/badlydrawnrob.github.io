    Recipe super fast demo
    ============================================================================

    Focus on the core message and story, with the core abstract features.
    The core features for most profiles are:

    - Currency (gold, silver, bronze)
    - Time (in a hurry)
    - Price (min/max/mean)
    - Location radius
    - Filters (one ingredient)

    Questions
    ---------
    1. Can we only use `Advert a` in the update function?
        - I think so! I think you need to first narrow type for `alias record`
        - Then narrow type for the particular `alias record a` update type
    2. We're using a `visible` boolean for our `Meals` to filter on
        - Is there a better way to do this?
        - We need the "full list" and the "filtered list" somehow
    3. Should I use alphabetical for all the things?
        - `{ record deconstruct }`) etc
        - `model.record`, `model.order` etc

    Wishlist
    --------
    1. Currently filtering by a single ingredient ... which is a form
    2. `List Ingredient` is in TWO places: `model.meals` and `model.advert`
    3. What about errors? Currently does nothing if `"ingredient"` doesn't exist
    4. Start thinking about better structures for:
        - `Model` and `Currency` etc
        - `User` and adding/editing (plus wishlist etc)
        - Master list of `Ingredients`
        - User interactions (three ingredients picked, filters, etc)

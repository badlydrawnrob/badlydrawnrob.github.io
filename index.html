<h1 id="title">Data for humans | robmcdonald.me</h1>

<p>Life is a learning process. It&#8217;s full of big hairy problems (and little ones too!). I solve problems <b class="highlight highlight-underline">for people</b> with data.</p>

<h2 id="whichpeople">Which people?</h2>

<pre><code class="python">people = ['academics','agencies','brands','startups']
</code></pre>

<p>People are not a <abbr title="number">#</abbr>. They&#8217;re not just a statistic. They&#8217;re individuals, complex, emotionally driven.</p>

<p>I help [people, big and small,] achieve a people-first approach to data, answering questions like:</p>

<ol>
<li>How many customers are we losing due to their first experience with us?</li>
<li>Sales took a hit last month â€”Â which products are likely to sell this month?</li>
<li>How do we streamline our process so we can spend more time creating actionable insights, less time cleaning up sloppy data?</li>
</ol>

<p>If someone <b class="highlight highlight-underline">eats</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">drinks</b>, <b class="highlight highlight-underline">buys</b>, or <b class="highlight highlight-underline">reads</b> it; chances are I can help.</p>

<h2 id="ðŸŽ¯valuesandgoals">ðŸŽ¯ Values and goals</h2>

<p><del>Everything is a priority.</del> <strong class="highlight highlight-underline">This</strong> is our priority right now. Here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to try and solve it, here&#8217;s how we know if it&#8217;s been a success.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m making a few assumptions here:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re busy.</li>
<li>You have too much to do, too many distractions, too little time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not sure where to start? Not sure what creates the most value? Not sure what Not sure what [&#8230;]</p>

<ol>
<li>Test hunches</li>
<li>Track success</li>
</ol>

<p>[Your target &#8211; my process &#8211; boring data]</p>

<h3 id="therearenosilverbullets">There are no silver bullets</h3>

<p>Data analysis is an art; it can take a few attempts to nail it. My role is to challenge your assumptions, create tiny experiments, and bring you insights on your people.</p>

<p>The rest is up to you.</p>

<p>Customer insights, Ã  la carte</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My latest research project is the booming indy food scene in Newcastle. Helping &#8220;The Journey&#8221; to find the drivers of growth and customer experience by asking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Who are our customers?</li>
<li>Why are they visiting?</li>
<li>When are they visiting?</li>
<li>What for?</li>
</ol>

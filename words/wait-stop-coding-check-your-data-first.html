        <!-- #! Requires a better intro, such as a BlockQuote style -->
        <p>Now I’m not the best of coders; I’m good to an educational
        level but I don’t have much experience (yet) building big
        things. I don’t code often enough. This results in lots of
        forgotten syntax, sifting through code becomes a chore, or I
        simply can’t fit it all in my head and see the flow of the code.
        This happens often.</p>
        <p>I once was told “if you’re not coding 12 hours a day, you’re
        going to struggle”. That sounds about right — unless you’ve
        built up your muscle memory and trained your brain into a
        finely-tuned code killing machine by doing it day in, day out,
        you’re going to come unstuck. That’s a given. But it doesn’t
        mean you can’t help yourself out by reducing complexity and
        producing clean code that’s sense-making.</p>
        <p>In a recent attempt at doing form validation, which can be
        difficult, I stumbled upon a few good lessons. It’s mostly
        focused on functional, but it serves for any code you might
        write:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Start with the simplest thing possible …</li>
        <li>Write it down! Sketch it out!</li>
        <li>What data types do you need?</li>
        <li>What are your function inputs? It’s outputs?</li>
        <li>What, exactly, do the functions need to do?</li>
        <li>Write them down too! Any gotchas?</li>
        <li>Now follow the “5 steps to reduce your code”.</li>
        <li>Rewrite your code to the simplest thing possible.</li>
        <li>How does that code look now?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Too many times I’ve started to attack a problem by writing
        code first. You can follow the <a
        href="https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_preface.html">design
        recipe</a> on this page<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> but personally,
        I find it very helpful to write that thing down, sketch it out
        like a flowchart, boxes, squiggles, comments, whatever it takes
        to visually represent those inputs, functions, and outputs for a
        solid representations of <em>what it’ll take to code</em> the
        damn thing.</p>
        <h2 id="the-two-routes-one-complex-one-simple.">The two routes:
        one complex, one simple.</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Can you guess which one is simple?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <!-- Image of the two routes -->
        <p>There’s A LOT you can learn from doing that. A good example
        is the form inputs above. To begin with, I only started typing
        the first route and <em>didn’t even consider the second
        route</em> until I found out I was unpacking a
        <code>Maybe</code> and converting a <code>String</code> in a lot
        of places. It made sense originally, as I couldn’t find a
        function in <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm Lang</a> (based
        on Haskell) that would help me count the decimal points of a
        <code>Float</code>. Turns out <em>you can</em> <a
        href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/myrho/elm-round/latest/">truncate
        decimal points</a> with a package or <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31952975">some maths</a> (not
        my strong point) but I didn’t look for those up front and
        decided to count the number of decimal points instead (with
        string functions).</p>
        <p>So, you have the original data type (a form field input of
        <code>String</code>) and you know the output (a
        <code>Float</code>) and you’ve got a rough idea of how to get
        there. That’s great, but without considering different routes
        upfront, you risk writing messy, over-engineered code.</p>
        <p>I hate state. HATE it. Functional programming seems to call
        for endless lines of wrestling, cajoling, smoothing, just to
        make something move. Take a retro space invaders game, for
        example.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> There’s a lot of state
        there. Bounding boxes. Moving parts. I can’t begin to imagine
        how difficult modern gaming is to create. I’m happy enough to
        follow a tutorial, but I’m not the kind of person who enjoys
        figuring out how to make games. The less state the better as far
        as I’m concerned – that goes for user-interfaces and forms
        too.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it stems from my design background, where old-school
        design was generally fixed visuals without much motion.
        Everything seems to be motion nowadays. Whatever the reasons, I
        aim for simplicity and fewer lines of code wherever possible. To
        me, that’s simpler to deal with, simpler to read in a few months
        time, and suits my brain which isn’t that logic-oriented (in a
        computer science way). For my purposes, I’m interested in
        pragmatic code that helps me build a business or test an idea. I
        can always hire someone for the tough stuff — I’m not out to
        save the world with code! That’s just me.</p>
        <p>I digress. Back to the problem. So we have:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>An input type of <code>String</code> which converts to a
        <code>Float</code></li>
        <li>This stands for <em>minutes</em> and <em>seconds</em> for
        time</li>
        <li>Multiple things that could go wrong with that output …</li>
        <li>Which we structure as a <code>Result</code> with
        <code>Err</code>ors or an <code>Ok Float</code></li>
        <li>This needs to prompt the user to fix those errors</li>
        <li>And until then, the cycle continues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Route 1 sounds simple enough, but we need to check for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>String</code> is empty</li>
        <li><code>String</code> is a <code>Float</code></li>
        <li><code>String</code> is a “proper” <code>Float</code> (two
        decimal points)</li>
        <li>Decimal points are within range (<code>&lt;= 10</code>
        minutes and <code>&lt;= 60</code> seconds)</li>
        <li>And a few other potential errors (such as negative
        values)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So you’ll see that our errors compound and our “simple” idea
        of a text box expecting a <code>Float</code> is becoming a bit
        harder. On top of <em>that</em> functional typed programming
        adds an extra layer of “difficulty” that Javascript or Python
        doesn’t. I won’t get into the differences between static and
        dynamic languages; all you need to know is that code gets
        compiled (converted from Elm Lang to Javascript) and any errors
        are checked as it’s compiled. With route 1 you’re going to get a
        lot of these types of errors:</p>

        <pre class="terminal"><code>The 1st argument to `update` is not what I expect:

10|   update &quot;a little string&quot;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This argument is a string of type:

    String

But `update` needs the 1st argument to be:

    Maybe String</code></pre>
        <p>I won’t go into detail what a <code>Maybe</code> type is, or
        what type-safety means, as that isn’t really the point of this
        article. The point is that anything adding complexity to the
        code should be met with suspicion. As Elon Musk points out with
        his “5 steps to reduce code”, requirements can be dumb, and you
        should always try to delete or simplify the process and
        resulting code <em>before</em> you reach for anything else. The
        same can be said for HTML, CSS, design, or just about
        anything.</p>
        <p>So our requirements are already creating A LOT of potential
        errors, our code has to unpack a lot of <code>Maybe</code>s and
        <code>Result</code>s, it falls down in it’s processing of the
        <code>String</code>. My first route also stipulates that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A <code>Float</code> needs to be tested in many ways</li>
        <li>It needs to be converted from a <code>String</code> to a
        <code>Float</code> (at least twice)</li>
        <li>But also needs to be converted from a <code>String</code> to
        two <code>Int</code>s in one function
        <ul>
        <li>To check minutes and seconds are within range</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>As well as all that, there’s three <code>Result</code> types
        to be chained together, and if the <code>String</code> is
        <code>Ok</code> it needs to change on the very last
        <code>Result</code> to a <code>Float</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You see the complexity building up? You don’t need to know
        how to code to look at all these steps and see that a simple
        problem is now becoming complex. There’s also the (annoying?)
        fact that Elm Lang converts a <code>"2.00"</code> and a
        <code>”2.10”</code> to <code>2</code> and <code>2.1</code>. Its
        type is still a <code>Float</code>, but we now have the extra
        complexity of handling that case if we’d really prefer them to
        keep their decimal points.</p>
        <p>All these extra problems add up, from the top of the stack
        (front end form) to the bottom (a <code>json</code> file that
        holds the data).</p>
        <h2 id="counting-the-steps-in-the-process">Counting the steps in
        the process</h2>
        <p>You really only need to count the steps in the process, all
        the handling of data you’d need to do, all the states the
        end-user would see, as bullet points or sketches to figure out
        how complex your route <em>really</em> is. You might be
        surprised!</p>
        <!-- Picture of route 2 -->
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Two <code>Int</code> inputs</li>
        <li>One for minutes and one for seconds</li>
        <li>Each must be within a certain number range</li>
        <li>Minutes must be more than zero</li>
        <li>That’s about it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now contrast this with route 2. This is just an example: your
        problem might have a few routes. Perhaps one route isn’t the
        best way to do it — perhaps it’s not the fancy, shiny way your
        user would prefer — but it’s SIMPLE. And simple adds up. Simple
        reduces the code base down by 80% (in this case). Simple reduces
        the error states. Simple makes my life a whole lot easier. And
        <em>that’s</em> what I’m looking for. There’s been a few
        occasions where I’ve aimed for something smarter, and what’s
        popped out the other end takes so much more effort to achieve.
        The data you use <em>matters</em>.</p>
        <p>Take for example the days of the week. We could represent
        these as an <code>Int</code> for each day, from <code>0</code>
        to <code>6</code> (using index style formatting) as does
        <em>Beginning Elm</em> in it’s <a

        <p>So far so simple, but I wasn’t content with this and went on
        a journey <a
        href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/a-simple-list-recursion-problem-how-do-i-do-this/9628">to
        use recursion</a> (which I won’t go into) and a list of tuples,
        which looks like
        <code>[(0,“Monday”), (2,“Tuesday”), (3,“Wednesday”)]</code> and
        so on. Feels somewhat more solid as a data type, but took a
        considerable amount of time to nail down. I’ve studied plenty of
        recursion with <em>How To Design Programs</em> by <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoofXuKqMY">Matthias
        Felleisen</a> and Co. —  It’s a great book, perfect for 1st
        years at Uni/College and just about anyone who wants to
        <em>think</em> like a programmer — there’s not too much maths,
        and it’s helpful even if you don’t pursue a career in
        CompSci.</p>
        <p>And yet. All that recursion gets forgotten when you start
        using <code>.map</code>, <code>.filter</code>,
        <code>.reduce</code>, and all the other time-saving functions
        Elm Lang provides. You find you’re spending less time on
        recursion problems and more time with <code>List.map</code>
        where the hard work is done for you. A great thing! The downside
        of this is ask me to write a function like
        <code>List.sort</code> from scratch (to alphabetise a list, say)
        and I’d struggle without tutorials and documentation (to do it
        <em>properly</em> is no easy task).<a href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I learned recursion in
        Racket Lang (Lisp) and I’d hazard a guess that recursion in a
        strongly typed and functional language like Haskell or Elm is
        that little bit harder to do.</p>
        <p>Recursion and typed functional languages take a certain way
        of thinking — a bit like mathematics (lamda calculus, actually)
        — it’s not a natural way for a human to think. Especially THIS
        human. I’m visually, not logically oriented, and if I compare
        myself to developer friends, we <em>think</em> differently. Some
        folks can think in code. Some are almost robots.</p>
        <p>The gist of these examples is to <em>learn and do only what
        you need</em> to get a thing done and <em>keep it simple</em>
        wherever possible. For some, that’s taking it for a weekend
        drive as a hobby, for others diving deep, deep, into the abyss
        of Haskell, or throwing it out of a window in a fit of rage.
        Programming is oft too academic, too dense, too complicated, too
        frustrating, and I doth my cap at anyone who gets through it.
        Sometimes you have to go through that pain to learn a simpler
        way to do it, so use my pain as a learning experience!</p>

        <p>Ok, so we’ve realised there’s a problem, figured out a better
        data type — two <code>Int</code>s for <em>minutes</em> and
        <em>seconds</em> — and figured out that using a
        <code>Float</code> is causing us headaches. We know exactly what
        our functions have to do: check each <code>Int</code> is within
        range (<code>&lt;= 60</code> minutes for example). We’ve
        followed the <em>5 steps to reduce your code</em> to chop off
        all those unnecessary <code>Maybe</code> and <code>String</code>
        functions. It took some pain to get there, but we shouldn’t
        forget that pain, and use it as a positive force for future

        <p>It’s missing a check for <code>Nothing</code> (is not a
        <code>String</code>), but otherwise looking good!</p>
        <p>One final (minor? major?) note is on the topic of
        <code>input[type=“number”]</code>. There’s an interesting
        article on why the number input is the worst type of input. You
        can read about it <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/12/26/why-the-number-input-is-the-worst-input/">here</a>.
        Always sanitise your inputs!</p>
        <p>And I think that’s all there is to it. Route 1 started out as
        400 lines of comments, questions and code and we’re down to 20.
        Twenty! That’s progress.</p>
        <h2 id="next-time">Next time …</h2>
        <p>So the next time I’m thinking about adding a feature, dealing
        with forms, checking some errors, I’m asking myself — from the
        customer request, to the shaped problem, the user-interface,
        right down to the <code>json</code> data — how can I reduce as
        much complexity as possible and make the process a little more
        joyful? What can I bin? How can I reduce it down?</p>
        <p>If it’s a new area of work that I’ve had no experience in,
        there’s bound to be some pain and uncertainty, new things to
        learn and people to ask for help. But in problem areas I’ve
        covered before I should be stacking up stories to teach me a
        lesson. To never do that dumb thing again. To reduce friction.
        To ask myself …</p>
        <p>What’s the simplest thing possible?</p>

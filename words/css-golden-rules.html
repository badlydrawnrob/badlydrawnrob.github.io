          to split a float string and run checks on it takes A LOT MORE EFFORT than
          simply using two ints for `minutes` and `seconds` fields. You might even
          have to deal with `time` in that instance. Proper programming is HARD. -->
          <p>The general gist is: keep it as simple as possible, while
          doing just enough to solve the problem. Sometimes that might
          mean making it <em>more</em> complex, before simplifying it
          again. It‚Äôs a delicate balance to design and code a
          user-interface, to arrive at a solution that‚Äôs pleasant to
          walk around, maintainable, and good code.</p>
          <p>For my own needs, I rarely want to build anything with more
          complexity than you might find in a Kindle or Kobo
          user-interface; for many things, basic text-elements are just
          fine. To write with brevity and concision is in general my
          preference, for writing and CSS. I‚Äôm not sure if this article
          will come across that way, but I hope so!</p>

          don‚Äôt want to write it</h2>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Start from a position of a lazy coder, and limit the amount
          of code you have to write. This works hand-in-hand with a lazy
          designer!</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Basic CSS is pretty easy, but it can get complex quickly,
          and there‚Äôs quite a bit of it that‚Äôs not particularly obvious.
          It‚Äôs not like regular programming where there‚Äôs often one way
          to do it (the Python way); layouts are infinitely flexible and
          subjective. The language that combines visual with logic can
          be far more difficult than the same design using software.
          Take <code>line-height</code> for example, and a
          <code>.baseline-grid</code>. It‚Äôs trivial in InDesign to align
          all text to a baseline grid, making slight alterations for
          smaller font sizes. As the user-interface becomes more
          visually complex, this becomes harder to achieve, and it‚Äôs
          <em>far</em> easier to stick to a simple line-height with
          CSS.</p>
          <p>Add in the different states of your UI, the variety of HTML
          elements you, or the user might provide, and the
          <code>x-height</code> of fonts (which isn‚Äôt the same), and CSS
          frameworks are going to fall down eventually. Browsers are far
          more reliable these days, and one will generally render the
          same as another, but slight visual differences can become
          large changes in code.</p>
          <p>On top of that, there‚Äôs specificity, inheritance,
          server-side template languages, browser adoption, and so much
          more that your design software just doesn‚Äôt need to consider.
          A beautiful and fancy design can <em>feel</em> nice, but
          coding that up might be a real chore. Take a quick look at the
          <a
          href="https://tailwindflex.com/@lukas-muller/book-appointment-form-2">mountain
          of classes</a> Tailwind uses to get an idea of how much CSS
          <em>you could use</em> if you so desired.</p>
          <p>So TL;DR, write for your lazy future self, creating a
          visual experience that‚Äôs pleasing to the eye, but easily
          maintainable.</p>

          <p>There‚Äôs <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/">a great
          forum on Reddit</a> where people try to explain things in the
          most simplistic style possible, hence the name ELi5 (explain
          it like I‚Äôm five). This was also üìñ <a
          href="https://archive.org/details/Surely-youre-joking-mr.-feynman/mode/2up">Richard
          Feyneman‚Äôs</a> creed and he once said ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt explain
          something in simple terms, you don‚Äôt understand¬†it‚Äù, or
          something along those lines.</p>
          <p>Not only should you start with the simplest thing possible
          (a <a href="https://typespecimens.xyz/">specimen file</a>),
          the code‚Äôs purpose should be crystal clear. What was that
          <code>.cryptic-Class</code> named for? Why isn‚Äôt the
          <code>.box</code> class in your design-system file? Why use a
          javascript plugin when <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> does
          everything you need, and is more descriptive?</p>
          <p>CSS and HTML will evolve, as well as the programming
          languages that compliment them, so changes are inevitable. But
          as much as possible, your code, templates, design-system, etc,
          shouldn‚Äôt break in 5 years time, and should be well organised
          and <code>&lt;!‚Äî commented --&gt;</code> so it‚Äôs meaning is
          clear.</p>

          <p>A good writer is in need of a good editor. I‚Äôm a fan of

          done with a harsher critic, creating better cohesion and
          stronger cuts. Some of that is personal opinion, but other
          works, such as some programming books I‚Äôve read could be cut
          down and simplified (with academic words culled). There was a

          <h2 id="a-distaste-of-state.-seriously.-cut-it-out.">A
          distaste of state. Seriously. Cut it out.</h2>
          <blockquote>
          <p>State is anything that deals with movement, elements
          changing, memory, data updating, and so on. It‚Äôs one of areas
          that adds great complexity if you aren‚Äôt careful.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I personally have an aversion to state. I wouldn‚Äôt
          seriously call myself a programmer, but I‚Äôve done it enough to
          know that, for instance, gaming is a seriously time-consuming
          thing to code. There‚Äôs so much state, and especially if it‚Äôs
          functional, a lot of code to write. CSS animations,
          user-interface changes, <code>-variations</code>, menu hover
          states, or any ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù functionality, are all extra
          things to consider when building and maintaining your app or
          website.</p>
          <p>Unless you like this sort of thing (which I really don‚Äôt),
          keep your state simple. Forms are a great example. Relying on
          one field‚Äôs answer to inform the next field requires memory
          and logic. The more ‚Äústate‚Äù (logic or memory) the form needs
          to remember and keep updated, the harder that becomes to
          reason about. Relying on 2-3 field‚Äôs inputs and having them
          determine what a user sees next can become confusing to
          manage, quickly.</p>
          <p>So aim for simplicity. Wherever there‚Äôs an animation, a
          reliance on memory, or template logic, try <a
          href="#5-steps-to-reduce-your-code">5 steps to reduce your
          code</a> and see if you can‚Äôt make life easier for

          <h2 id="dont-get-complected.">Don‚Äôt get complected.</h2>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Complected is a beautiful word with a deadly sting. To join
          by weaving: for code to become ‚Äúcomplected‚Äù.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Just like functional programming aims to split out
          functions and abstract similar ones, you should avoid weaving
          and interlacing your CSS code too much. Isolate your styles
          with reasonable names, so your <code>.gl-PullQuote</code>
          relies on nothing but itself. A <code>.child-of-parent</code>
          class should only depend on it‚Äôs parent and your base styles
          (your specimen file). Nothing more.</p>
          <p>Adding needless complexity and dependence, such as using
          Less CSS <a
          href="https://lesscss.org/functions/">functions</a> or <a
          href="https://lesscss.org/#mixins">mixins</a>, however useful
          they might be, creates a coupling (to that framework) that you
          don‚Äôt really need. Adding a dependancy on a class that‚Äôs
          unrelated to the job at hand, or inheriting one class from
          another, also creates complected code. If you only rely on
          browser-supported CSS, and if every class isolates the problem
          <em>within</em> itself, you can be assured it‚Äôs not going to
          break. The only time I‚Äôd lean on Less is where functionality
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/nested-media-queries/">isn‚Äôt
          allowed</a> in regular CSS, but is handy, such as:</p>
          <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
          class="sourceCode css"><code class="sourceCode css"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">.wrapper</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">margin</span><span class="ch">:</span> <span class="dv">20</span><span class="dt">px</span><span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="im">@media</span> <span class="an">screen</span> <span class="kw">and</span> <span class="fu">(</span><span class="kw">orientation</span><span class="ch">:</span> <span class="dv">portrait</span><span class="fu">)</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        margin<span class="in">:</span> 0 auto; <span class="co">/* CSS won&#39;t allow nested `@media` queries yet */</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    }</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
          <p>So this is a very <em>light</em> dependency, but it‚Äôs still
          a minor <em>complected</em> one. I could just as well stick to
          using regular <code>@media</code> queries and nesting the
          <code>.class</code> inside them. So, however you structure
          your code, if you can‚Äôt be confident your HTML and CSS will
          work in 5‚Äî10 years, reduce the amount of complexity ‚Äî and
          rarely complect!</p>

          <p>ECSS was a big proponent of extreme isolation. If a style
          was the same in two different places, styles were duplicated
          and unique class-names given to each component. Scoping your
          css as <a
          href="https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki/blob/3b8a3bc3b1e11f4719adfacb9fc006cd99819fe0/source/themes/cards/simple/simple-front.mustache"><code>.simple-Card_KeyPoint</code></a>
          and <a
          href="https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki/blob/3b8a3bc3b1e11f4719adfacb9fc006cd99819fe0/source/themes/cards/missing/missing-front.mustache"><code>.missing-Card_KeyPoint</code></a>
          creates absolute certainty that one can never influence the
          other, but at the cost of lots of repetition of code. <a
          href="https://medium.com/@jescalan/bem-is-terrible-f421495d093a">GPS</a>,
          on the other hand, aims to reduce code duplication to a bare
          minimum, while generating reusable styles for components, and
          scoping unique <code>#page</code> level css with
          <code>#sections</code> of content and non-reusable
          classes.</p>
          <p>DRY code isn‚Äôt always possible (or even desirable in some
          instances), but it‚Äôs a good place to start. If you find
          yourself needing to reuse a <code>#section</code> on a
          different page, it should be moved up a notch to a
          <code>.gl</code>obal element. Conversely, if a global element
          needs adapting for a particular page, you might consider
          converting it into a <code>-variable</code> or
          <code>#section</code>.</p>
          <p>TL;DR: You want as much of your styles as possible to be
          together in a single location, as simple as possible, in as
          few lines of code as possible.</p>

          At the time of writing, advertising has become massively
          simplified, often using a short phrase, sentence or word, with

          <p>Your CSS should be no different to those ads. The more
          state, animations or layers you add, the more code needs to be
          generated and tested to see that idea to life. I‚Äôve been from
          top to bottom, learning design for print, digital, and
          eventually frontend (and backend) code. I‚Äôm definitely no
          Picasso when it comes to coding, but I understand what happens
          when you add complexity. It‚Äôs harder to manage, harder to
          test, harder to maintain. Unless you‚Äôve got a large team and
          money/time to burn, keep it simple, stupid!</p>

          much out as possible.</p>

          <p>There‚Äôll come a time, possibly often, where you‚Äôve got a
          layout that is <em>exactly</em> the same, but for a few minor
          differences. There‚Äôs a <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpDsk374LDE">great
          talk</a> by Evan Czaplicki (the creator of Elm Lang) on
          programming two widgets which <em>seem</em> the same, but are
          actually very different. In the video, he explains assuming
          the same approach for both may not work. Now, while css is a
          lot simpler than functional programming, that video outlines a
          sensible approach. If you try and shoehorn in changes, you can
          add complexity to the component, which is less preferable

          <h3 id="be-careful-of-inheritance.-isolate.">6. Be careful of
          inheritance. Isolate.</h3>
          <p>Inheritance can be a chore, which is why many of these CSS
          frameworks aim to isolate or reuse styles wherever possible.
          Just try styling a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element with
          plain CSS to see how quickly you reach for a framework that
          does it all for you! These days, I like to keep my websites
          simple, available to print with <code>@media print</code>
          styles, then reduced and distilled into a tight package which
          loads quickly in the browser. That might not suit all
          projects, especially if you‚Äôre visualising a lot of data, but
          for reading and simple customer journeys, it serves.</p>
          <p>The more CSS you write, the more chance that somehow,
          somewhere, you‚Äôve overridden a style that shouldn‚Äôt have been,
          or adding complexity that needn‚Äôt be there. If you‚Äôre writing
          styles like <code>h2 &gt; p + p &gt; span a:hover</code>
          you‚Äôre asking for trouble; what if I have more than one
          paragraph? How do I remember <em>exactly</em> what goes where
          in my HTML? What‚Äôs the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag for? Why
          is <em>this</em> <code>:hover</code> state different from the
          <code>/base/html</code> hover state? Is that necessary? Is
          that easy to understand? Will it break something?</p>
          <p>If you have a big team, multiply that risk by 10, and
          you‚Äôll soon land yourself in trouble. Limit how many colours
          you‚Äôve got, limit the amount of <code>+</code> and
          <code>&gt;</code> you‚Äôre using, make your CSS concise,
          descriptive, and explicit. Prefer a global design-system over
          random <code>:hover</code> states. Make use of unique
          <code>#page</code> and <code>#section</code> IDs. Isolate
          styles for each component.</p>
          <p>Before you reach for your toolbox of CSS selectors or add
          another design element¬†‚Äî stop and think. As a rule I start
          with NO. That‚Äôs NO to that new design element. NO to
          complexity. NO to fancy CSS that I‚Äôll forget how to write in 2
          years. NO to a complicated stylesheet that I‚Äôll have to
          maintain. Aim for simplicity, actively reduce the amount of
          code, sensibly add in constraints, which can often make design
          <em>more</em> attractive.</p>
          <p>That‚Äôs an ideal world and sometimes you have to please
          clients, but do <em>try</em>.</p>

          <p>A quote from some wise person. Write for your stupid future
          self.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I forget code <em>all the time</em>. I don‚Äôt pretend to be
          an expert, and I most definitely don‚Äôt know it all. CSS is an
          endless void that can suck you up without great care. The
          quicksand of complexity is really something that can‚Äôt be
          stated enough.</p>
          <p>If you‚Äôre like me and you want to write as little CSS as
          possible, then write for your stupid future self. I‚Äôm not a
          Google employee writing thousands of lines of code everyday,
          which means if I leave a project alone for a few months,
          there‚Äôll be a few things I either don‚Äôt understand or have
          forgotten the purpose of ‚Äî¬†even if I‚Äôve followed all my own
          rules! Keep your <code>.class</code> names explicit, simple;
          add some carefully placed and well-worded comments.</p>
          <p>Add links to documentation or articles. You‚Äôll need them in
          future, believe me. I once wrote a <a
          href="https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/print-first-css/blob/fea925978558329112859e94f9525dd96c552882/source/style/globals/baseline-grid.less"><code>.gl-BaselineGrid</code></a>
          class and I can count on one hand how many times I‚Äôve used the
          <code>linear-gradient</code> feature of CSS. Which order do I
          write the <code>deg</code>ree direction, the colours, the
          <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> of each colour? How
          in the hell did I do that <code>background-size</code> thing?
          I can‚Äôt remember, I‚Äôd have to look it up. I have 41 lines of
          comments in my <code>baseline-grid.less</code> file. How to
          use it, how I learned it, how to <code>toggle()</code> it on
          and off, so on. Ideally, I want to write it once and forget
          about it ‚Äî¬†forever.</p>
          <p>And on the topic of using a preprocessor ‚Äî be it SASS or
          Less ‚Äî I‚Äôd advise ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT DO IT!‚Äù, don‚Äôt treat CSS like a
          programming language; it isn‚Äôt one! Well, not really. The only
          reason I use <code>.less</code> files now is to simplify my
          codebase, so each file is focused on one thing:
          <code>text-elements.less</code> for example, or
          <code>horizontal-rules.less</code> to get more granular. It‚Äôs
          also pretty handy for <code>npm watch</code>ing changes in my
          stylesheets, so I can render that in the browser in real-time.
          Then I can minify and uglify or whatever.</p>
          <p>For anything else (and I mean ANYTHING) just use plain old
          CSS. Heck, even <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting">nesting
          and <code>&amp;</code></a> is in the latest version of CSS.
          That‚Äôs great! And if you‚Äôre just starting out, please,
          <em>please</em> at least learn the basics first before using
          Tailwind. If something breaks, you‚Äôll be lost.</p>

          Seriously the worst experience I‚Äôve had with onboarding. They
          supposedly have the best connectivity in the UK, but it‚Äôs
          likely I‚Äôll never use them again. Here‚Äôs how the story
          goes:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>I bought a sim at a local store.</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>Their UX and UI is <em>awful</em>. Impossible to figure
          out how to link that sim.</li>
          <li>When I finally managed to, the deal on the sim wasn‚Äôt the
          deal I could get.</li>
          <li>So I chose a sim on their online store with a cool
          package. Something went wrong and I needed to contact customer
          service to cancel that package ‚Ä¶</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><strong>During the sign-up process, they asked for
          sensitive details:</strong> my date of birth.
          <ul>
          <li>I purposefully submitted the <em>wrong</em> date of birth
          so it‚Äôs not stored in the ether.</li>
          <li>It‚Äôs <em>nowhere</em> to be seen in my online profile.
          Gone. Nada. Nixt.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><strong>Customer service continuously ask for said
          details</strong> which <em>I can‚Äôt view or edit</em> online.
          <ul>
          <li>Their automated telephone service <em>says</em> you can
          edit it by phone ‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>But it gave no options I could find, so I gave up on that
          route ‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>Three times I attempted to cancel my ordered sim ‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>It simply can‚Äôt be done without your date of birth ‚Ä¶</li>
          <li>And there‚Äôs no way around this. <em>Even though</em> they
          can send a passcode to my mobile to verify it‚Äôs really
          me.</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li><strong>I gave up.</strong> It pissed me off so much, it‚Äôs
          unlikely I‚Äôll use their service again.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Ever had an experience like that? At a restaurant or a
          store? There is a big long list of <em>what not to do</em>.
          You‚Äôd think a company so large would‚Äôve got their user
          experience sorted out, but anyway. The moral of that tail is
          somone had a great idea that date of birth is the go-to
          security method, but they neglected to tell their dev-team.
          Don‚Äôt put your readers or your customers through that.</p>

          <li id="fn1"><p>This is the simplest option. If your design
          has slight differences, such as the colour of a heading, you
          can add a <code>.gl-Parent-red header</code> variant. This
          assumes that the code order is the same; if the order of the
          code is in question, such as a <code>margin-bottom</code>
          change because the <code>header</code> is in a different
          position, better change it into a <code>gl-Standalone</code>
          element, or at least set the header‚Äôs margin dependant on it‚Äôs
          <code>-variant</code> and not it‚Äôs position.<a href="#fnref1"

          to a <code>.gl-Parent</code> element. If it lives on it‚Äôs own,
          its <code>.gl-Standalone</code> element (no children). For
          example, <code>.gl-Image</code> contains a

          this method to nest the page ID inside our element, like
          <code>.gl-Component { #page &amp; { ... } }</code>. This will
          render our styles when <code>.gl-Component</code> is a child
          of <code>#page</code>. The downside of this approach is we
          have to remember, and search for, our <code>#page</code>
          element‚Äôs styles outside it‚Äôs main chunk of code, or file.

          between both. For example, a <code>.gl-Card</code> and a

            <p><strong>Creativity without constraints</strong> is a
            little like a satellite without an orbit ‚Ä¶ It can drift off
            in any direction, which isn‚Äôt much help to anyone!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I‚Äôve been around the block and back a few times by now; I
            have a tendency towards ethics and principles, but pragmatic
            enough to know how the world really works. Our values and
            goals are often a matter of perspective, but I find a
            <em>manifesto</em> (in one form or another) a useful
            tool.</p>
            <p>While our orbits might twist and turn, isn‚Äôt it a good
            idea to plot a path?</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><strong>Make it as simple as possible, but never
            simpler</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Reduce complex ideas to achievable goals, split into
            tasks, completing one task at a time. Learn as you go, be
            like <a href="http://www.feynman.com">Feynman</a>.</li>

            people I collaborate with, or the <a

            degrees of separation</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>Keep it secret, keep it safe</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>In a connected, digital, data-obsessed world,
            <em>privacy matters</em>. As a society it‚Äôs our job protect
            the people we serve, even when mind-numbingly difficult (oh
            how I love you, <a
            href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">GDPR</a>)</li>

            <li>It may be Jane, the new mum, trying to organise life;
            Mike the cafe owner, too busy to think; or Jaylah, the
            apathetic millennial who wants it right now. Be respectful
            of people‚Äôs time.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong><em>Why</em> is more important than
            <em>how</em></strong>
            <ul>
            <li>I‚Äôll forgo the rant about <em>too many [useless,
            wasteful, ‚Ä¶] <code>X</code></em> in the world. What‚Äôs the
            <em>focus</em>? what‚Äôs the <em>goal</em>? What is it
            <em>for</em>? Why <em>bother</em>?</li>

            <li><strong>Humans are more important than robots</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>As a recovering tech fatigue victim myself, I‚Äôd love to
            ‚Äî¬†in some small way ‚Äî¬†contribute to a humanist vision.
            Although the <a
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload">science
            still isn‚Äôt clear</a> on an always-connected world, I
            believe without constraints tech can have a negative impact
            on mental health. Online communication is <em>not the
            same</em> as offline interaction; for me, online should
            <em>only</em> be a means of improving <em>offline</em>
            conversations, relationships and life.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Open doors are better than closed ones</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>One of my, yet to be proven, theories is that
            collaboration is ‚â• a hyper-competitive marketplace. Healthy
            competition is fine, but I‚Äôm happy to collaborate with
            people who share the same values.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Life, is a learning process</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>As in, you‚Äôre never done. In these divisive times, we
            could all do with getting a little more comfortable with
            <em>doubt</em>. Start small, conquer your fears, test what
            can be tested, but try not to make too many
            assumptions.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Never stick to a goal that has been proven
            wrong</strong>
            <ul>
            <li><em>Wrong</em>, as in <em>Truth‚Ñ¢</em>, can be highly
            subjective and this rule is <em>extremely</em> hard to
            follow. No matter how much data you collect, you can never
            know the full picture. Be honest with yourself and others;
            do the best job with the information at hand; help as much
            as possible; harm as little as possible.</li>

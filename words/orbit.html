        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Creativity without constraints</strong> is a little
        like a satellite without an orbit ‚Ä¶ It can drift off in any
        direction, which isn‚Äôt much help to anyone!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I‚Äôve been around the block and back a few times by now; I
        have a tendency towards ethics and principles, but pragmatic
        enough to know how the world really works. Our values and goals
        are often a matter of perspective, but I find a
        <em>manifesto</em> (in one form or another) a useful tool.</p>
        <p>While our orbits might twist and turn, isn‚Äôt it a good idea
        to plot a path?</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Make it as simple as possible, but never
        simpler</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Reduce complex ideas to achievable goals, split into tasks,
        completing one task at a time. Learn as you go, be like <a
        href="http://www.feynman.com">Feynman</a>.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>No bullshit</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Aim to be a source of Truth‚Ñ¢, earn the trust of the people I
        collaborate with, or the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six
        degrees of separation</a>.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Keep it secret, keep it safe</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>In a connected, digital, data-obsessed world, <em>privacy
        matters</em>. As a society it‚Äôs our job protect the people we
        serve, even when mind-numbingly difficult (oh how I love you, <a
        href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">GDPR</a>)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Make it easy, make it seamless</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>It may be Jane, the new mum, trying to organise life; Mike
        the cafe owner, too busy to think; or Jaylah, the apathetic
        millennial who wants it right now. Be respectful of people‚Äôs
        time.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong><em>Why</em> is more important than
        <em>how</em></strong>
        <ul>
        <li>I‚Äôll forgo the rant about <em>too many [useless, wasteful,
        ‚Ä¶] <code>X</code></em> in the world. What‚Äôs the <em>focus</em>?
        what‚Äôs the <em>goal</em>? What is it <em>for</em>? Why
        <em>bother</em>?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Humans are more important than robots</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>As a recovering tech fatigue victim myself, I‚Äôd love to ‚Äî¬†in
        some small way ‚Äî¬†contribute to a humanist vision. Although the
        <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload">science
        still isn‚Äôt clear</a> on an always-connected world, I believe
        without constraints tech can have a negative impact on mental
        health. Online communication is <em>not the same</em> as offline
        interaction; for me, online should <em>only</em> be a means of
        improving <em>offline</em> conversations, relationships and
        life.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Open doors are better than closed ones</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>One of my, yet to be proven, theories is that collaboration
        is ‚â• a hyper-competitive marketplace. Healthy competition is
        fine, but I‚Äôm happy to collaborate with people who share the
        same values.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Life, is a learning process</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>As in, you‚Äôre never done. In these divisive times, we could
        all do with getting a little more comfortable with
        <em>doubt</em>. Start small, conquer your fears, test what can
        be tested, but try not to make too many assumptions.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Never stick to a goal that has been proven
        wrong</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Wrong</em>, as in <em>Truth‚Ñ¢</em>, can be highly
        subjective and this rule is <em>extremely</em> hard to follow.
        No matter how much data you collect, you can never know the full
        picture. Be honest with yourself and others; do the best job
        with the information at hand; help as much as possible; harm as
        little as possible.</li>
